:page-description: New features and enhancements

This page lists the new features and enhancements introduced in the ThoughtSpot Developer portal, Visual Embed SDK, and REST APIs.

== May 2021
The latest release of ThoughtSpot Cloud consists of several new and enhanced features for the  ThoughtSpot Developer users.

=== Custom actions in the context menu
You can now add a custom action to the contextual menu to send data or initiate an action from an embedded visualization. The *Customization* > *Actions* page in the *Develop* tab allows you to add a custom action to the contextual menu for visualizations in the *Search Answers* or *Pinboards* page. 

[NOTE]
This feature is available only if the  link:https://cloud-docs.thoughtspot.com/admin/ts-cloud/new-answer-experience[New Answer experience, window=_blank] is enabled on your ThoughtSpot instance.  

For more information, see xref:customize-actions-menu.adoc[Add custom actions]. 

=== Visual Embed SDK 1.2.0
The ThoughtSpot 7 Cloud May release introduces the Visual Embed SDK 1.2.0 version with minor updates and backward-compatible improvements. 

==== SAML authentication
The Visual Embed SDK packages now include the `noRedirect` attribute as an optional parameter for  the `SSO` `AuthType`. If you want to display the SAML authentication workflow in a pop-up window, instead of refreshing the application web page to direct users to the SAML login page, you can set the `noRedirect` attribute to `true`.

For more information, see the instructions for embedding xref:full-embed.adoc[ThoughtSpot pages], xref:embed-search.adoc[search], xref:embed-pinboard.adoc[pinboard], and xref:embed-a-viz.adoc[visualizations].

==== Visual Embed SDK notification when third-party cookies are disabled
When a user accesses the embedded application from a web browser that has third-party cookies disabled, the Visual Embed SDK emits the `NoCookieAccess` event to notify the developer. Cookies are disabled by default in Safari. Users can enable third-party cookies in Safariâ€™s Preferences setting page or use another web browser.
To know how to enable this setting by default on Safari for a ThoughtSpot embedded instance, contact ThoughtSpot Support.  

For more information on allowing third-party cookies on Safari, see xref:browser-settings.adoc[Browser settings for embedding].
